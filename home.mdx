# OKR UI

An open source user interface for building OKR centric applications with React.

## Example

Here's a working example:

---

<Okr metrics={metrics} grades={grades}>
	<Objective>
		<Row type="flex">
			<Goal label="Objective" text="Carve out a niche" />
			<Due
				label="Due date"
				date="2022/01/01"
				options={{ year: "numeric", month: "short", day: "numeric" }}
			/>
		</Row>
		<Progress label="progress" value={0.75} />
		<Result>
			<Row type="flex">
				<Goal
					label="Key Result"
					direction="increase"
					metricId="1"
					start={20}
					end={50}
				/>
				<Row type="flex">
					<Current
						className="okr-mr-1"
						label="Current"
						metricId="1"
						value={30}
					/>
					<Score
						className="okr-ml-1"
						direction="increase"
						start={20}
						end={50}
						current={30}
						circle
					/>
				</Row>
			</Row>
		</Result>
		<Result>
			<Row type="flex">
				<Goal
					label="Key Result"
					direction="increase"
					metricId="1"
					start={20}
					end={50}
				/>
				<Row type="flex">
					<Current
						className="okr-mr-1"
						label="Current"
						metricId="1"
						value={30}
					/>
					<Score
						className="okr-ml-1"
						direction="increase"
						start={20}
						end={50}
						current={30}
						circle
					/>
				</Row>
			</Row>
		</Result>
		<Result>
			<Row type="flex">
				<Goal
					label="Key Result"
					direction="increase"
					metricId="1"
					start={20}
					end={50}
				/>
				<Row type="flex">
					<Current
						className="okr-mr-1"
						label="Current"
						metricId="1"
						value={30}
					/>
					<Score
						className="okr-ml-1"
						direction="increase"
						start={20}
						end={50}
						current={30}
						circle
					/>
				</Row>
			</Row>
		</Result>
	</Objective>
</Okr>

## Gettin Started

Getting started is easy. Simply install the package via npm:

```
npm install react-okr-ui
```

Once installed, import the components you need into your React app:

```js
import { Okr, Objective, Result, Goal } from "react-okr-ui/components";
```

To view all the component in action, check out the playground [here]("/components#example").

## Features

React OKR UI provides everything you'll need to quickly build OKR experiences Including:

### Components

A collection of highly compositional components for a wide range of possible OKR UI requirements:

- **OKR**: contain your OKR and configure
- **Objective**: contain and layout your objective
- **Goal**: display your objective, and calculate result text from props
- **Due date**: process and display a due date with label
- **Progress bar:** display a provided percentage value, or calculate percentage progress from results
- **Result:** contain and layout your key result
- **Current value:** display a current value, with label in a specific metric (e.g., percentage, money, etc.)

### Services

- **Calculate progress:** take in results and return objective progress.
- **Calculate grade:** calculate result grade from score.
- **Calculate score:** calculate score from start, end, and current result value.

### Configuration

As much as possible OKR UI has been designed to apply to a range of requirements. Configure:

- **Metrics:** what metrics do you measure? Keep results consistent with pre-defined metrics.
- **Grades:** how do you measure success? Customize how progress and score is graded.

## First principles

- **Strongly compositional:** quickly scaffold UI and maintain data visibility.
- **Minimal dependencies:** low bloat. Just components and a few helpful utilities.
- **Un-opinionated:** limited assumptions. Manage state, data, style, your way.
